Estimate your chances of winning in the 6/49 lotto system

This project determines your chances of winning or partially winning the 6/49 lotto. For historical lotto data, we imported Candadian lotto data from kaggle.

The goal is to educate lottery addicts that the probability of winning the lottery is always really low which hopefully discourages people that do not have enough dispensible income to support this addiction.
